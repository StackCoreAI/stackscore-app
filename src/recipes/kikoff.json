    "why": "Low-cost installment tradeline that reports monthly to build on-time history.",
    "cost": "$5–10/mo",
    "reportsTo": ["Experian", "Equifax", "TransUnion"],
    "features": [
      "Credit Builder account",
      "Autopay",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Go to https://kikoff.com and create an account using the same legal name as on your credit files.",
      "Choose the Credit Builder plan; skip add-ons for now to keep costs tight.",
      "Link the checking account you use for monthly bills to reduce payment failures.",
      "Turn ON Autopay (Settings → Billing → Autopay) and note the first draft date.",
      "In Settings → Credit Reporting, ensure all three bureaus are toggled ON.",
      "Add a calendar reminder 3 days before draft; keep your balance ≥ $25 to avoid returns.",
      "Verification: After 7–14 days from first draft, check for a new installment tradeline on Credit Karma (TU/EQ) and Experian."

    "pitfalls": [
      "Do not miss the very first payment; your first 60 days are the foundation.",
      "If the tradeline doesn’t appear after 2 statements, check for name/address mismatches and update Profile before contacting support."
