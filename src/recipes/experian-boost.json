    "name": "Experian Boost",
    "why": "Adds eligible utility, phone, and streaming payments to your Experian file for an immediate score lift.",
    "cost": "$0",
    "reportsTo": ["Experian"],
    "features": [
      "Boost connection",
      "Continuous sync",
      "Alerts"
    ],
    "steps": [
      "Create/sign in at https://www.experian.com using the exact legal name on your credit reports.",
      "Go to Boost and select “Connect Accounts.” Link the checking account you use to pay utilities and streaming bills (avoid savings).",
      "When prompted, authorize a full 12–24 months of transaction history to surface more eligible bills.",
      "In the Boost scanner, prioritize utilities and mobile phone first, then add 2–3 streaming services.",
      "Confirm continuous syncing is ON (Settings → Boost → Keep this account linked).",
      "Save a screenshot of the “Bills added” confirmation for your records.",
      "Verification: Your Experian score should reflect Boost immediately. If it doesn’t, clear filters, re-scan, or re-link the bank connection."
    ],
    "pitfalls": [
      "Joint or mirrored accounts (via money-management apps) can hide bills—temporarily unlink those before linking Boost.",
      "If eligible bills don’t appear, check bank filters and try a re-scan after 24 hours."
