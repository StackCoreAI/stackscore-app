    "name": "Chime Credit Builder",
    "why": "Spend-based secured card that reports on-time payment behavior without interest.",
    "cost": "$0/mo (requires eligible Chime account)",
    "reportsTo": ["Experian", "Equifax", "TransUnion"],
    "features": [
      "Credit Builder Secured Card",
      "Safer Credit Building (autopay-on-file)",
      "Round Ups (optional)",

    ],
    "steps": [
      "Open/verify your Chime account (same legal name as your credit files).",
      "Activate Credit Builder and move a small, predictable budget ($50–$150) into the secured balance.",
      "Enable Safer Credit Building so your monthly statement auto-pays from your secured funds.",
      "Set card-on-file for 1–3 small recurring bills (e.g., music/video subscriptions).",
      "Turn ON alerts for card charges, statement ready, and payment posted.",
      "Keep monthly spend predictable and allow the auto-payment to post in full.",
      "Verification: Look for the Credit Builder tradeline to report within 4–8 weeks of first statement."

    "pitfalls": [
      "Transferring too little can cause declined charges; keep a buffer above your recurring bill total.",
      "Manually paying off before statement close can sometimes reduce reported activity—let the autopay flow run."
