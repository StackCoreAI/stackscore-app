      "Create an account at https://www.kovo.com with your exact legal name.",
      "Choose a low monthly installment you can sustain for 6–12 months.",
      "Link your primary checking account and enable Autopay immediately.",
      "Turn ON alerts for draft scheduled and draft posted.",
      "Keep your account funded ≥ 3 days before draft to prevent returns.",
